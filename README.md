# SQLite Core Data Services - OData on NodeJS 
This project is intended to expose OData services using SQLite single file database on NodeJS runtime.

Ideally, an SQLite schema is to be copied to the root folder and OData service should be automatically exposed by the project.
Active development is on.

# Inspiration
This project is inspired by SAP HANA CDS and expects to provide full feature set of core data services on a light database.
As CDS feature of HANA allows developers to build backend services at lightning speed, We aim building CDS on SQLite database in matter of no time.
